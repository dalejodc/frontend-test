                All that we do is work on the style of life, on "being." The object as such is not very interesting. I
                wonder how people will live with him, what metamorphoses he will undergo in the house. I always liked
                very simple things. In all. Doing simple things is the most difficult thing. If we talk about
                simplicity, then it is a synthesis.
