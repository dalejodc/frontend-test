                <p class="experience-description">The world of design is ruled by diversity, and it's good. Another
                    question is whether to consider a lot of pieces of furniture as trash. That's it is this
                    responsibility — to create things, not junk, —
                    lies on the designer and the company-manufacturer. Bad architecture is even more harmful.
                    <br>
                    If you make an ugly, uncomfortable and expensive chair, then it will be forgotten very quickly, but
                    if you build a
                    terrible building — it will stay for twenty years and make many unhappy.</p>

                <p class="experience-description">More than the design process itself, I am interested in inventions,
                    engineering and marketing ... I think that a good designer is someone who manages to unite all the
                    elements: the understanding of materials and the belief in increasing functionality. Then the
                    reduction to the form, if you like, becomes the result of all these experiments.</p>

                <p class="experience-description">My work is simple and sophisticated, so it can be described in both
                    simple and florid language. I love sophistication and I feel its superiority. I like people with a
                    sophisticated mind and at the same time simple in communication. These qualities can be combined
                    quite naturally. However, objects, like people, look pathetic if these properties are connected in
                    them artificially.</p>
